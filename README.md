team code overview

Hi Coders!!! This is the team code for the Highland Park High School _(NJ not Illinois)_ Robotics Club!!! Goooo OWLS!!!!!!

Just a few notes before we go, for members of the FUTURE...future...future...future to keep this code hideout nice and ORGANIZED...organized...organized...organized:

**//what's what**
- **Projects**: r for like to-do lists, assignments, assignees, all that jazz
- **Repositories**: r for actual code files :) --> REMEMBER: when naming ur file u gotta add the **.type (Ex: .java)** don't forget!!!

**//laws of code** 
- **Copy-paste** is a part of ur utility belt... use it!!! There is **reference/sample FTC code** from https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge as a neat repository: https://github.com/HPHS-Owls-Robotics/ftc-reference-code
- Blind copy-paste is useless tho, read through the copied code, actually **understand what's going on**! Add comments, make modifications, ur a coder!!!
- **//COMMENTS ARE AMAZINGGGG** - help ur peers understand ur java jargon with some friendly comments! Just like neat handwriting, comments will make looking back at old code 3000x easier and 3000x funner _(funner is a word guys, trust me)_
- we all love squirtle but do **not** name variables based on unrelated Pikachu characters!! also do **not** name methods with excessively long names activateTheMethodThatDoesCoolStuffs() could just be cool()

**//managing tips**
- Try to keep more than 1 owner (Ex: Captian/President + Head Programmer) so that in the event ur missing 1 person u got another with the same accessibilities!
- Plus the more the merrier right? Nope. Don't let it get too cluttered and out of hand!!! For example:
- when members graduate u can convert their role from member/owner to outside collaborator... this way alumni can still help when needed but Github doesn't have the chance to say u have too many members (GitLab did that to us...)
- Coordinate and collaborate with ur peers, or all of u r gonna end up creating 10 files for the red alliance auto-op and zero for the blue!

Have fun!!!
